# Code of Conduct

We, the members of the Cyber Security community, are committed to creating a respectful, inclusive, and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of their background, identity, or skills. To ensure a positive experience for all participants, we have established this code of conduct:

## Our Standards

1. **Be Respectful**: Treat all community members with respect and kindness. We will not tolerate harassment, bullying, or disrespectful behavior.

2. **Inclusivity Matters**: Our community is open to everyone, and we respect and value diversity. Discrimination and exclusion are not acceptable.

3. **Zero Tolerance for Drama**: We're here to focus on cybersecurity and learning. Drama, gossip, and personal conflicts have no place in our community.

4. **Defend Our Code**: We respect each other's work and give credit where credit is due. Plagiarism, unauthorized copying, or malicious tampering with code is strictly forbidden.

5. **Keep it Fun**: We aim to create a positive, fun, and inclusive atmosphere. So, let's focus on learning and sharing in a lighthearted way.

## Reporting Violations

If you encounter any behavior that violates our code of conduct, please report it to the project maintainers. We take such reports seriously and will respond appropriately to maintain a safe and respectful environment for everyone.

## Enforcement

Our project maintainers are responsible for enforcing our code of conduct. They will address reported violations and work towards a resolution that is fair and just. The severity and consequences of violations will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

Thank you for contributing to a positive and respectful community. By participating in the Cyber Security project, you agree to abide by this code of conduct.
